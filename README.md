# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Additional information

This app was created as an additional side project for educational purposes with Lexicon.
Design choices were made with intention to keep the app functional yet minimalistic. The information comes out clear and has
    decent enough contrast between the data information's naming and the actual data.

### USING THE APP

The app has two ways of being run. 
    - Getting the code into a folder and running it from the terminal within Visual Studio Code through the command: 'npm start'. More compound explanations and commands found above. 
        This method will allow you to also host the code on your own custom domain.

    - Running the website through the hosted (examplary) domain: 'http://bjorn-vdv.github.io/package-tracking'
        Should this domain somehow fail to load, please search for the top line within "Package.json" and read the "homepage" line to confirm whether the link is still accurate. If the links match, it means Github has temporarily or permanently disabled the domain for an undeterminable reasoning.
